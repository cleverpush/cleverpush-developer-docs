        target 'CleverPushNotificationServiceExtension' do
          use_frameworks!

          pod 'CleverPush/CleverPushExtension'
        end
        ```
    6. Run `pod install`
    7. Open `NotificationService.m` and replace the whole content with the following:

        ```objective-c
        #import <CleverPush/CleverPush.h>

        #import "NotificationService.h"

        @interface NotificationService ()

        @property (nonatomic, strong) void (^contentHandler)(UNNotificationContent *contentToDeliver);
        @property (nonatomic, strong) UNNotificationRequest *receivedRequest;
        @property (nonatomic, strong) UNMutableNotificationContent *bestAttemptContent;

        @end

        @implementation NotificationService

        - (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest *)request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent * _Nonnull))contentHandler {
            self.receivedRequest = request;
            self.contentHandler = contentHandler;
            self.bestAttemptContent = [request.content mutableCopy];

            [CleverPush didReceiveNotificationExtensionRequest:self.receivedRequest withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent];

            self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
        }

        - (void)serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire {
            [CleverPush serviceExtensionTimeWillExpireRequest:self.receivedRequest withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent];

            self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
        }

        @end
        ```

3. Create your iOS push certificate

   1. Open Keychain Access on your Mac. (Application > Utilities > Keychain Access).
   2. Select Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...
   3. Select the "Save to disk" option and enter any information in the required fields
   4. Go to the [Apple developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle), select your app and press "Edit"
   5. Enable "Push notifications" and press "Done"
   6. Go to the [Create new certificate page](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create), select "Apple Push Notification service SSL" and press "Continue"
   7. Select your Application Bundle ID and press "Continue"
   8. Press "Choose File...", select the previously generated "certSigningRequest" file and then press "Generate"
   9. Press "Download" and save your certificate
   10. Click on the downloaded .cer file, Keychain Access should open
   11. Select Login > My Certificates then right click on your key and click "Export (Apple Production iOS Push Services: com.your.bundle)..."
   12. Give the file a unique name and press save, be sure to leave the password field blank!
   13. Upload your certificate in the CleverPush channel settings
   

4. Add AppGroup (optional but recommended)

    1. Select your main application Target in Xcode
    2. Go to `Capabilities` and activate `App Groups`
    3. Create a new App Group with the following Scheme: `group.YOUR.BUNDLE.ID.cleverpush` (replace `YOUR.BUNDLE.ID` with your application's bundle identifier).
    4. Enable the created App Group by checking the checkbox next to it
    5. Select the `CleverPushNotificationServiceExtension` target and also enable the created App Group under `Capabilities`
